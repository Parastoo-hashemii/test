            <p>The Parthenon is a former temple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, that was dedicated to the goddess Athena during the
            fifth century BC. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art, an enduring symbol of
            Ancient Greece, democracy and Western civilization.</p>

            <p>The Sistine Chapel is a chapel in the Apostolic Palace, in Vatican City and the official residence of the pope.
            Originally known as the Cappella Magna ('Great Chapel'), the chapel takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV, who had it built
            between 1473 and 1481. Since that time, the chapel has served as a place of both religious and functionary papal
            activity. Today, it is the site of the papal conclave, the process by which a new pope is selected. The fame of the
            Sistine Chapel lies mainly in the frescoes that decorate the interior, most particularly the Sistine Chapel ceiling and
            The Last Judgment, both by Michelangelo.</p>

                    Islam's most important mosque, the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is the most sacred site in Islam.[3] It is
